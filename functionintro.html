    <div class="main"><p>A <span> function </span>is a named PL/SQL block like procedure that can accept parameters and be invoked Generally speaking, a function is mainly used to compute a value Functions and procedures have a similar structure, except that the functions have a RETURN clause. i.e a function must return a value to the calling environment
    <br>
    Like a procedure, a function has a header a declarative section, an executable section, and an optional exception handling section. A function must have a RETURN clause in the header section and at least one RETURN statement in the executable section. 
<br>Functions can be stored in the database as a schema object for repeated execution. A function stored in the database is referred to as a stored function.
<br>

Functions promote reusability and maintainability. When validated they can be used in any number of applications. If the processing requirements change, only the function needs to be updated.

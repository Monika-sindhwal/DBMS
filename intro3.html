  <div class="main"><p><span>VIEW</span> is a virtual table, through which a selective portion of data from one or more tables can be seen. A view contains no data of its own but it is like a 'window' through which data from tables can be viewed or changed. The tables on which a view is based are called base tables. Base tables might in turn be actual table or might be views themselves. All operation performed on a view like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE affects the data in the original table upon which the view is based. You can use views in almost the same way as tables. You can query, update, insert into, and delete from views, just as you can standard tables.</p></div>

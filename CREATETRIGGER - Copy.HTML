<BR></BR>    <span>EXAMPLE</span>
    <BR></BR>
    <div class="example">
The price of a product changes constantly. It is important to maintain the history of the prices of the products.
<BR></BR>
        We can create a trigger to update the PRODUCT PRICE HISTORY table when the price of the product is updated in the PRODUCT table . 
        <BR></BR>
        STEP 1:CREATE THE 'PRODUCT TABLE ' AND 'PRODUCT_PRICE_HISTORY' TABLE.
        <PRE class="ex">
            CREATE TABLE PRODUCT (
            product_id number(5),
            product_name varchar(32),
            supplier_name varchar(32), 
            unit_price number);
                        
            CREATE TABLE PRODUCT_PRICE_HISTORY(
            product_id number (5),
            product_name varchar(32), 
            supplier_name varchar(32),
            unit_price number
                            );
            </PRE>
STEP 2:INSERT VALUES INTO 'PRODUCT' TABLE:
<PRE class="ex">
INSERT INTO PRODUCT VALUES(1001,'BOOK','NEW WAY',500);
    </PRE>
STEP 3:CREATE THE HISTORY_TRIGGER AND EXECUTE IT:
    <PRE class="ex">
CREATE OF REPLACE TRIGGER HISTORY_TRIGGER
BEFORE UPDATE OF unit_price ON PRODUCT
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
INSERT INTO PRODUCT_PRICE_HISTORY VALUES (:old.product_id,
:old.product_name,
:old.supplier_name,
:old.unit_price);
END;
 </PRE>
 STEP4: LET'S UPDATE THE PRICE OF A PRODUCT:
 <BR></BR>
 <PRE class="ex">
UPDATE PRODUCT
SET unit_price =800
WHERE product_id = 100; 
 </PRE>
Once the above update query is executed, the trigger fires and updates the PRODUCT PRICE HISTORY table

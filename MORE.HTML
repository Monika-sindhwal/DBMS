 <div class="main">  <H1>More Info: SQL and PL/SQL</H1>

    Welcome to the "More Info" page dedicated to SQL and PL/SQL on our college project website! Here, you'll find additional information about these powerful database technologies, including their features, benefits, and applications.
    
   <H2>About SQL</H2> 
    
   <SPAN>Structured Query Language (SQL) </SPAN> is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a set of commands for performing various operations on data stored in a database, including querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data. <BR></BR>
    
    Key Features of SQL
    <BR></BR>
    Data Querying: SQL allows users to retrieve specific information from a database using queries, including complex queries involving multiple tables and conditions. <BR></BR>
    Data Manipulation: SQL supports operations for modifying data in a database, such as inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records. <BR></BR>
    Data Definition: SQL provides commands for defining and modifying the structure of database objects, including tables, indexes, views, and constraints. <BR></BR>
    Data Control: SQL includes features for managing access to data, including granting and revoking permissions, enforcing security policies, and ensuring data integrity. <BR></BR>
    <H2>About PL/SQL</H2>
    
   <SPAN>PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language)</SPAN>  is an extension of SQL that adds procedural programming capabilities to the language. It allows users to write procedural code, such as loops, conditional statements, and exception handling, directly within SQL statements. <BR></BR>
    
    Key Features of PL/SQL
    <BR></BR>
    Procedural Constructs: PL/SQL supports procedural constructs, such as loops, conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE), and exception handling (TRY-CATCH), allowing users to write complex logic and control structures. <BR></BR>
    Stored Procedures and Functions: PL/SQL allows users to define and execute stored procedures and functions, which are reusable blocks of code stored in the database and called by other SQL statements or applications. <BR></BR>
    Triggers: PL/SQL supports triggers, which are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain database events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. <BR></BR>
    Error Handling: PL/SQL provides robust error handling mechanisms, including exception handling, which allows users to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of PL/SQL code. <BR></BR>
    Applications of SQL and PL/SQL <BR></BR>
    
    SQL and PL/SQL are widely used in various industries and applications, including: <BR></BR>
    
    Database Management Systems: SQL is the standard language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. <BR></BR>
    Web Development: SQL is used in web development to query and manipulate data stored in databases, such as retrieving user information, storing session data, and managing content. <BR></BR>
    Enterprise Applications: PL/SQL is commonly used in enterprise applications to implement business logic, automate business processes, and enforce data integrity constraints. <BR></BR>
    Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence: SQL is used in data warehousing and business intelligence applications to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from multiple sources and generate reports and analytics. <BR></BR>

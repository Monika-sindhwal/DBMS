    <h1>DROPPING A VIEW</h1>
    <P>You can drop any view contained in your schema. To drop a view in another user's schema, you must have the DROP ANY VIEW system privilege. DROP VIEW statement is used to drop a view from a database. The syntax of DROP VIEW statement is:

    </P>
    
        <pre>
DROP VIEW view_name;</pre>
    <p><span>EXAMPLE</span></p>
    <div></div>
    <BR>
    <div class="example">
<PRE class="ex">
DROP VIEW V1;
        </PRE>
    The above table will drp the view V1 from the database. Dropping a view has no affect on the base tables on which view is based. Users who were accessing the data of the base tables using view will no longer be able to access the data of the base table through views.</div>

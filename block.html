    <span>PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language)</span> follows a block structure that defines the scope and boundaries of executable code. A PL/SQL block consists of several optional sections, including declarations, executable statements, exception handling, and SQL statements. Here's a breakdown of the structure:
    <br>

<span>Declaration Section</span>: This section is optional and used to declare variables, cursors, constants, types, and other program elements. Declarations are made using the DECLARE keyword.

<span>Executable Section</span>: This section contains the actual procedural code that performs computations, manipulates data, and controls program flow. It is enclosed within the BEGIN and END keywords.

<span>Exception Handling Section</span>: Also known as the exception block or error handling block, this section is optional and used to handle runtime errors and exceptions gracefully. It is enclosed within the EXCEPTION keyword.
